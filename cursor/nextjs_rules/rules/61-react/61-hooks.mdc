# 61-react: Hooks Discipline (Client Components)

## REQUIRED
- Name hooks `use{Name}`; one hook, one clear purpose; define an explicit return type (interface) for the hook.
- Hooks are client-only. Keep them inside the smallest possible client island.
- Do not fetch or hold server-owned data in hooks when that data can be provided by a Server Component.
- Prefer built-in platform/React APIs; add custom hooks only when reuse is proven.

## Error + rejection handling (optional but consistent)
If you implement a global client error capture hook:
- attach/remove listeners in `useEffect`
- capture both:
  - `error`
  - `unhandledrejection`
- provide a `reset()` mechanism

## FORBIDDEN
- ❌ Hooks that fetch server-owned data which could be loaded in a Server Component.
- ❌ Hooks with side effects that run on every render (missing deps).
- ❌ Storing derived data in state when it can be computed.
