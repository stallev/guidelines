# 11-architecture: Loading UI + Streaming Discipline

## REQUIRED
- Use `loading.tsx` for **route-level** loading only.
- Use `<Suspense fallback={<SectionSkeleton />}>` for **section-level** streaming.
- `page.tsx` must be composition-only:
  - no heavy `await` at root
  - no role checks / data reads that block first chunk
  - async work belongs in child async Server Components.

## Skeleton rule (no duplication)
- Every async section exports:
  - `Section` and `SectionSkeleton`
- The same skeleton must be reused in:
  - `<Suspense fallback={...}>`
  - `loading.tsx` (when relevant)

## FORBIDDEN
- ❌ A single giant Suspense around the entire page (kills streaming benefits).
- ❌ Duplicating the same skeleton markup in multiple places.
- ❌ Putting long-running `await` in layouts.
