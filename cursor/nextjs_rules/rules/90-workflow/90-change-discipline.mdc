# 90-workflow: Change Discipline

## REQUIRED before coding
- Identify whether the task affects:
  - Architecture (RSC/loading)
  - Data/mutations (actions vs api)
  - Performance (bundle)
  - UI (admin rules)
  - Forms (form pattern)
Follow applicable rules.

## Required PR-style self-check (even locally)
- Did you add `'use client'`? If yes: justify and keep it local.
- Did you add a new dependency? If yes: justify and lazy-load if heavy.
- Did you add a mutation? Choose Server Action vs Route Handler using the decision rule.
- Did you add a public page section with data? Wrap it in Suspense and add a skeleton.

## FORBIDDEN
- ❌ Refactors unrelated to the task.
- ❌ “While I’m here” changes that expand scope.


## Executor mindset (non-negotiable)
- Execute the requested change, not a redesign.
- If requirements are missing: propose options; do not guess and implement.
- Verify against a checklist relevant to the change.

## Verification hooks (pick what applies)
- UI behavior: run Playwright reproduction.
- Public pages: run Lighthouse/PageSpeed snapshot.
- Console errors: confirm clean console via DevTools/console integration.
