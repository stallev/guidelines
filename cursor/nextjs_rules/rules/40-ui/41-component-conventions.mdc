# 41-ui: Component Conventions (React + TS)

## REQUIRED
- Components are arrow functions:
  - `export const Component = (props: Props) => { ... }`
- Prefer named exports for tree-shaking.
- Explicit props interfaces in TypeScript.
- Accessibility: provide ARIA labels where needed; focus states must work with keyboard.
- Single responsibility per component; prefer composition over inheritance.
- Keep skeleton and UI components to a reasonable size (~100 lines); split into smaller components if larger.

## FORBIDDEN
- ❌ `React.FC` unless you have a specific reason (rare).
- ❌ Mutating props or relying on render-time mutations.

## Framework boundaries
- Server Components must not import client-only dependencies.
- When a component needs interactivity, split into a Server wrapper and a small client island; keep the client boundary as small as possible.
