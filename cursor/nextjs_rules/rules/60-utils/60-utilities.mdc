# 60-utils: Utility Functions (Server-safe + Client-safe)

## Definition
A utility is a **pure function**:
- deterministic
- side-effect-free
- no React hooks
- no access to browser globals at module scope

## REQUIRED
- Group utilities by domain (e.g. string, date, array, object, validation) under `src/lib/**` or the project's existing utilities folder.
- Every utility must have explicit argument and return types; keep a unit-test-friendly shape (no hidden dependencies).
- Prefer small, composable functions over "do-everything" helpers.

## FORBIDDEN
- ❌ Utilities that import from React or Next.js runtime modules.
- ❌ Mutating inputs.
- ❌ Reading `window/document/localStorage` at import time.
