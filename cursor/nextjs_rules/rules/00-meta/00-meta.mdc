# 00-meta: Rules of the Rules

These rules are **enforceable**. If something is not enforceable, it does not belong here.

## Conflict resolution
1. If two rules conflict, follow the rule with the **lower folder number**.
2. If still ambiguous, prefer:
   **Security > Correctness > UX > Performance > Style**.

## Language requirements
- Code and comments: **English**.
- UI labels: match the product language (default: English unless specified).

## Output discipline (for AI)
- Do **not** invent files. Only create/edit files explicitly requested by the task.
- Do **not** change unrelated code “for cleanup”.
- If a rule would be violated, stop and propose a compliant alternative.

## Definitions
- **Heavy await**: any DB call, network fetch, or slow auth/role lookup.
- **Client island**: a `'use client'` component imported by a Server Component.



## Scope: Next.js-only
- These rules govern **Next.js (App Router)** projects.
- Do not introduce or discuss infrastructure/vendor-specific services unless the task explicitly requires it.
- If a source doc mentions unrelated technologies, treat that as historical context and **do not carry those names into new code**.

## Hard safety rails (FORBIDDEN)
- ❌ Adding new libraries or tooling without an explicit request in the task.
- ❌ Inventing endpoints, schemas, env vars, or configuration.
- ❌ Copying patterns from other frameworks (Astro/Remix/etc.) into this project.
- ❌ Client-side data fetching (`useEffect` + fetch) for server-owned data when a Server Component can load it.
- ❌ Shipping console noise: no `console.log` in committed code (use typed logging only if the project already has it).

## When stuck
If the task is underspecified, do **not** guess. Propose 2–3 compliant options and state what each option changes.
