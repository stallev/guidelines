# 80-tooling: MCP-Assisted Debugging & Quality Gates

These are *behavior* rules: use the available MCP tools when they reduce guesswork.

## When you touch UI behavior or regressions
- Prefer an automated reproduction:
  - Use the browser automation tool (Playwright MCP) to confirm the bug and validate the fix.

## When you touch performance, SEO, or public pages
- Run a perf/SEO sanity check:
  - Lighthouse MCP for lab metrics and audits
  - PageSpeed MCP for field-ish reporting snapshots

## When you touch console/runtime errors
- Use DevTools/console integration (DevTools MCP + console-ninja) to:
  - capture the exact error message/stack
  - confirm it disappears after the change

## When design fidelity matters
- Use Figma MCP to pull spacing/typography specs instead of guessing.

## FORBIDDEN
- ❌ Claiming “fixed” without either:
  - a deterministic reproduction path, or
  - a tool-backed check (above), or
  - a minimal manual verification checklist.
