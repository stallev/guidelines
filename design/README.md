# Design Guidelines

This directory contains design guidelines, patterns, and best practices for creating consistent, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces.

## 📁 Contents

*Design guidelines are currently being developed. This directory will contain:*

- **Design System Guidelines**: Comprehensive design system documentation
- **Component Design**: Visual design patterns for UI components
- **Accessibility Guidelines**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design
- **Typography Guidelines**: Font choices, sizing, and hierarchy
- **Color Guidelines**: Color palettes, contrast, and theming
- **Layout Guidelines**: Grid systems, spacing, and responsive design
- **Animation Guidelines**: Motion design and micro-interactions

## 🎯 Design Principles

Our design guidelines are built on these core principles:

1. **Consistency**: Unified design language across all interfaces
2. **Accessibility**: Inclusive design that works for everyone
3. **Usability**: Intuitive and user-friendly interfaces
4. **Scalability**: Design patterns that grow with your application
5. **Performance**: Design decisions that support optimal performance
